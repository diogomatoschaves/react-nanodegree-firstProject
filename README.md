# Myreads Project - Udacity's React Nanodegree 1st Project

This project is a fork of the MyReads starter (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter), and encompasses the implementation of all the functionality as per the project's requirements. This app consists of a bookshelf that allows the user to select and categorize books that he/she has read, is currently reading, or wants to read. It also allows the user to search fro new books to add to these lists, although the search is limited to a particular set of search terms (see [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md)). In order to run the app you'll need to install the local dependencies as per `package.json` with `npm install`. In order to run the app use `npm start`.
